## Outline

**Title:** Introduction to Functional Programming
**Summary:** Functional programming (fp) isn't just crazy words like monad and applicative functor. Using fp techniques in classic languages can give huge benefits in code maintainability, readability, and simplicity. It also makes domains vastly easier to reason about like concurrency/asyc.

This talk will go through the basic ideas of functional programming, while leaving out the goofy terminology and fringe programming languages.
